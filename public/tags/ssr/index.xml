      <description>In this post, I am going to share some of my experiences and the benefits of using htmx to build modern, rich and interactive web applications driven by HTML which can serve as an alternative to the bloated, JavaScript heavy Single Page Application (SPA) approach.
HTML is the center of the universe HTML and CSS are the basic building blocks of the web. JavaScript was supposed to be a glue to work these two and to add some amount of interactivity and dynamism to our pages.</description>
