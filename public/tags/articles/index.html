      In this post, we are going to build a Twitter clone demo application using htmx. Before diving into the tutorial, let me tell you the background story about why I decided to build this app using htmx.
It all started with this blog post on A List Apart by Matt E. Patterson called The Future of Web Software Is HTML-over-WebSockets. In this article Matt talks about the advantages of sending HTML over the wire via AJAX requests or Web Sockets and the performance benefits they offer and he mentions tools and libraries like Hotwire, StimulusReflex and so on.

      In this article we are going to take a look at an Ember.js addon called ember-csz which provides template helpers for csz, a Runtime CSS-Modules with SASS like pre-processing.
This is based on a talk I gave recently at ESNextConf. I just wanted to experiment the same with Ember.js and it came out well. I liked it very much the idea of keeping your styles as part of your component.js just like how the React community uses other awesome CSS-in-JS solutions like Styled Components and Emotion.

      I have been thinking about playing songs inside Spacemacs for quite a while, so that I don&rsquo;t have to leave my favorite editor for just playing music. After a small exploration I found out that all I need is to enable EMMS inside Spacemacs.

      nvm is a version manager for Node.js, designed to be installed per-user, and invoked per-shell. nvm works on any POSIX-compliant shell (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash), in particular on these platforms: Unix, Mac OS, and Windows WSL. But most of the times, it is not properly identified by eshell in Spacemacs. Recently I found out a package called nvm.el by Johan Andersson.
Let&rsquo;s walk you through how you can use nvm to choose different Node.

      What is Spacemacs? Spacemacs is a community-driven Emacs distribution. It is a new way to experience Emacs with a sophisticated and polished set-up focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.
What is Prettier? Prettier is an opinionated code formatter which supports many languages and integrates with most editors. It can be installed through npm. It is recommended to install prettier globally in your system so that your editor integrates it properly and can be even made to auto formatted while saving your files.

Why Code coverage? In simple terms, code coverage is the fraction or percentage of code paths executed by some test or test suite of a program. It is generally measured by a tool which executes the test and logs the lines of code, the test &ldquo;touches&rdquo; while running.

Telemetry for layman First we will take a look at what Telemetry is all about. According to Wikipedia,
 Telemetry is the collection of measurements or other data at remote or inaccessible points and their automatic transmission to receiving equipment for monitoring.

      This article is the first in the series of articles about including and using PlantUML in Spacemacs to do some amazing things. In this article we will see how to setup PlantUML in Spacemacs and use it. In the upcoming posts we will see some advanced usage of PlantUML and some awesome stuff you can do with it.
Spacemacs Spacemacs is a community-driven Emacs distribution. It is a new way to experience Emacs with a sophisticated and polished set-up focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.

      In this tutorial, we will see how we can integrate the Merriam Webster Thesaurus in to Spacemacs. Having a thesaurus by your side while writing, is really a productive thing. Since you don&rsquo;t have to lookup every time the alternative word you want to use and that too integrating with your favorite editor is definitely a feather in your cap.
For this we are going to install an awesome package from Ag Ibragimov called mw-thesaurus.

      Conceptual integrity is the principle that anywhere you look in your system, you can tell that the design is part of the same overall design. This includes low-level issues such as formatting and identifier naming, but also issues such as how modules and classes are designed, etc. This is vitally important, because inevitably, unanticipated issues come up that must be resolved quickly. If there is a coherent design to the system, it can be much easier to resolve these issues by determining what would be consistent with the overall design, especially if the other designers are not present.

      Cognitive Dissonance in Programming In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. The occurrence of cognitive dissonance is a consequence of a person performing an action that contradicts personal beliefs, ideals, and values; and also occurs when confronted with new information that contradicts said beliefs, ideals, and values. In the fable of The Fox and the Grapes, by Aesop, on failing to reach the desired bunch of grapes, the fox then decides he does not truly want the fruit because it is sour.

In JavaScript, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. Objects penetrate almost every aspect of the JavaScript language. The object might be accessed as global or passed as an argument. Functions that have access to the object can modify the object, whether intentionally or accidentally. To prevent modification of our objects, one of the techniques is to use Object.

      Two simple ways to negotiate consensus in a software development group You can&rsquo;t reach consensus unless you recognize it when you have it in your grasp. This means that software development groups trying to reach collective decisions are wise to agree, in advance, on the criteria by which technical matters will be decided. What is important? What matters? What is “good” and what is “bad” within the confines of this particular project?

      The 10 typical sources of uncertainty in Software projects Suppose you had an utterly perfect process for delivering software. Would that remove all uncertainty from your projects? In fact, is the software building process even one of the major sources of uncertainty? Various project management approaches do not consider the impact that uncertainties have on the project. The identified threats by uncertainty in a project day-to-day are real and immediate and the expectations in a project are often high.

      Seven Principles of Software Development - Revisited Principle #1: The Reason It All Exists A software system exists for one reason: to provide value to its users. All decisions should be made with this in mind. Before specifying a system requirement, before noting a piece of system functionality, before determining the hardware platforms or development processes, ask yourself questions such as: Does this add real VALUE to the system? If the answer is no, don&rsquo;t do it.

      Arguing for the sake of arguments in JavaScript This article deals with some intricacies revolving around the arguments object, a magical and mysterious creature residing in the functional realms of the Javascript world, which can be summoned anytime in your code by the programming wizards without any spells, incantations or sorcery. The arguments object is an Array-like object corresponding to the arguments passed to a function. It is a local variable available within all (non-arrow) functions.

      The Four Factors of a Good Program If we plan to study programming as a human activity, we are going to have to develop some measures of programming performance. That is, we are going to have some idea of what we mean when we say that one programmer is better than another, or one program is better than another. Although we all have opinions on these questions, we shall find that the answers are not as simple as we might wish.

      Egoless Programming Egoless programming is a concept introduced by Gerald Weinberg in The Psychology Of Computer Programming. The idea is that programmers must fight the natural tendency to treat their programs as part of themselves, and therefore to reject all criticism. Rather, they should do their best to treat their designs &amp; implementations as objects independent of themselves, and to view criticism dispassionately on its merits. What is to be done about the ego problem in programming?

      The Twelve Roadblocks to Healthy Conversations What obvious obstacles are relevant to obstruct a conversation? Experts in interpersonal communication have identified various response patterns that tend to block conversation. Thomas Gordon devised a comprehensive list that he calls the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; of communication spoilers. These undesirable responses include:
Criticizing Making a negative evaluation of the other person, his/her actions, or attitudes. The act of passing judgment as to the merits of anything; censure; faultfinding.
