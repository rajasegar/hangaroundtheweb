      <description>In this post, we are going to build a Twitter clone demo application using htmx. Before diving into the tutorial, let me tell you the background story about why I decided to build this app using htmx.
It all started with this blog post on A List Apart by Matt E. Patterson called The Future of Web Software Is HTML-over-WebSockets. In this article Matt talks about the advantages of sending HTML over the wire via AJAX requests or Web Sockets and the performance benefits they offer and he mentions tools and libraries like Hotwire, StimulusReflex and so on.</description>

      <description>In this post, I am going to share some of my experiences and the benefits of using htmx to build modern, rich and interactive web applications driven by HTML which can serve as an alternative to the bloated, JavaScript heavy Single Page Application (SPA) approach.
HTML is the center of the universe HTML and CSS are the basic building blocks of the web. JavaScript was supposed to be a glue to work these two and to add some amount of interactivity and dynamism to our pages.</description>
