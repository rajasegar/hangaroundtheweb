      <description>In this post, we are going to share you a mind map of the book called The Craftsman by Richard Sennett.
Richard Sennett is a prime observer of society … one of his great strengths, the thing that makes his narrative so gripping, is the sheer range of his thinking and his brilliance in relating the past to the present.
The Craftsman is a complex but very rewarding read about craftsmanship, pride in one&amp;rsquo;s work and the differences between individual work and mechanical production, and the intellectual investment in the former versus the more mechanistic approach in the latter.</description>

      <description>This post is the second in the series of posts called PlantUML in Spacemacs. In this post we are going to see how we can create awesome Mind maps in Spacemacs using PlantUML. Mind map diagrams is the new feature recently rolled out in PlantUML and they are still in the beta* stage.
And you will find only minimal documentation in the official site related to mind map diagrams. This post gives you some additional bonus information such as adding colors to your mind map, creating high resolution mind maps and so on.</description>
