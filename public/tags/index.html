      Cognitive Dissonance in Programming In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. The occurrence of cognitive dissonance is a consequence of a person performing an action that contradicts personal beliefs, ideals, and values; and also occurs when confronted with new information that contradicts said beliefs, ideals, and values. In the fable of The Fox and the Grapes, by Aesop, on failing to reach the desired bunch of grapes, the fox then decides he does not truly want the fruit because it is sour.

 There is more than one way. There is always more than one way.

      A Refreshing Guide to Object.freeze in Javascript by Dr.Victor Fries What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age! In JavaScript, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. Objects penetrate almost every aspect of the JavaScript language. The object might be accessed as global or passed as an argument. Functions that have access to the object can modify the object, whether intentionally or accidentally. To prevent modification of our objects, one of the techniques is to use Object.

But why should it matter whether you and your office mate agree on the layout of an entry form or the best way to report error messages? Technical consensus is not about getting along together or feeling close to your fellow programmers. (Not that there is anything wrong with getting along or feeling good about each other.

Watching it will start us to thinking about old Bob and all the other “clarks” who kept the records for so many enterprises over the centuries.

      Two simple ways to negotiate consensus in a software development group You can&rsquo;t reach consensus unless you recognize it when you have it in your grasp. This means that software development groups trying to reach collective decisions are wise to agree, in advance, on the criteria by which technical matters will be decided. What is important? What matters? What is “good” and what is “bad” within the confines of this particular project?

The arguments object is an Array-like object corresponding to the arguments passed to a function. It is a local variable available within all (non-arrow) functions.

      The Four Factors of a Good Program If we plan to study programming as a human activity, we are going to have to develop some measures of programming performance. That is, we are going to have some idea of what we mean when we say that one programmer is better than another, or one program is better than another. Although we all have opinions on these questions, we shall find that the answers are not as simple as we might wish.

      Egoless Programming Egoless programming is a concept introduced by Gerald Weinberg in The Psychology Of Computer Programming. The idea is that programmers must fight the natural tendency to treat their programs as part of themselves, and therefore to reject all criticism. Rather, they should do their best to treat their designs &amp; implementations as objects independent of themselves, and to view criticism dispassionately on its merits. What is to be done about the ego problem in programming?

      The Twelve Roadblocks to Healthy Conversations What obvious obstacles are relevant to obstruct a conversation? Experts in interpersonal communication have identified various response patterns that tend to block conversation. Thomas Gordon devised a comprehensive list that he calls the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; of communication spoilers. These undesirable responses include:
Criticizing Making a negative evaluation of the other person, his/her actions, or attitudes. The act of passing judgment as to the merits of anything; censure; faultfinding.

It all started with this blog post on A List Apart by Matt E. Patterson called The Future of Web Software Is HTML-over-WebSockets. In this article Matt talks about the advantages of sending HTML over the wire via AJAX requests or Web Sockets and the performance benefits they offer and he mentions tools and libraries like Hotwire, StimulusReflex and so on.

What is Prettier? Prettier is an opinionated code formatter which supports many languages and integrates with most editors. It can be installed through npm. It is recommended to install prettier globally in your system so that your editor integrates it properly and can be even made to auto formatted while saving your files.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Conceptual integrity is the principle that anywhere you look in your system, you can tell that the design is part of the same overall design. This includes low-level issues such as formatting and identifier naming, but also issues such as how modules and classes are designed, etc. This is vitally important, because inevitably, unanticipated issues come up that must be resolved quickly. If there is a coherent design to the system, it can be much easier to resolve these issues by determining what would be consistent with the overall design, especially if the other designers are not present.

      Cognitive Dissonance in Programming In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. The occurrence of cognitive dissonance is a consequence of a person performing an action that contradicts personal beliefs, ideals, and values; and also occurs when confronted with new information that contradicts said beliefs, ideals, and values. In the fable of The Fox and the Grapes, by Aesop, on failing to reach the desired bunch of grapes, the fox then decides he does not truly want the fruit because it is sour.

But what really matters is to apply these practices where they make sense and where the users can benefit the most.

 The brute force method, also known as Proof by exhaustion, proof by cases, proof by case analysis, or the complete induction, is a method of mathematical proof in which the statement to be proved is split into a finite number of cases or sets of equivalent cases and each type of case is checked to see if the proposition in question holds.

In JavaScript, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. Objects penetrate almost every aspect of the JavaScript language. The object might be accessed as global or passed as an argument. Functions that have access to the object can modify the object, whether intentionally or accidentally. To prevent modification of our objects, one of the techniques is to use Object.

In fact, is the software building process even one of the major sources of uncertainty? Various project management approaches do not consider the impact that uncertainties have on the project. The identified threats by uncertainty in a project day-to-day are real and immediate and the expectations in a project are often high.

The idea is that programmers must fight the natural tendency to treat their programs as part of themselves, and therefore to reject all criticism. Rather, they should do their best to treat their designs &amp; implementations as objects independent of themselves, and to view criticism dispassionately on its merits.

      In this article we will take a look at some of the guiding principles which are beneficial while working with large code base.
The whole idea of this post is to collect and come up with a checklist of significant approaches and ways to deal with large and legacy code bases.
The readers are welcome to share more tools, methods and approaches in the comments section below.
1. Onboarding Documentation Ask if there is onboarding documentation, or someone who can give you a high-level overview of the codebase.

Criticizing Making a negative evaluation of the other person, his/her actions, or attitudes. The act of passing judgment as to the merits of anything; censure; faultfinding.

        Conceptual Integrity - Revisited

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Conceptual integrity is the principle that anywhere you look in your system, you can tell that the design is part of the same overall design. This includes low-level issues such as formatting and identifier naming, but also issues such as how modules and classes are designed, etc. This is vitally important, because inevitably, unanticipated issues come up that must be resolved quickly. If there is a coherent design to the system, it can be much easier to resolve these issues by determining what would be consistent with the overall design, especially if the other designers are not present.

Technical consensus is not about getting along together or feeling close to your fellow programmers. (Not that there is anything wrong with getting along or feeling good about each other.

      Two simple ways to negotiate consensus in a software development group You can&rsquo;t reach consensus unless you recognize it when you have it in your grasp. This means that software development groups trying to reach collective decisions are wise to agree, in advance, on the criteria by which technical matters will be decided. What is important? What matters? What is “good” and what is “bad” within the confines of this particular project?

      Six Corporate Habits and Rituals that seem to be far-fetched The emotional brain neither has the capacity for, nor believes in, experimentation. Whatever it does is to be done the same way every time. Simply put, it firmly believes in the motto:
 Experimentum periculosm - Experimentation is perilous.
 This conservatism is both an asset and a liability. Both individual habits and institutionalized habits or rituals must be checked from time to time to see if they are working for us or against us.

Quote #1  Of all my programming bugs, 80% are syntax errors. Of the remaining 20%, 80% are trivial logical errors. Of the remaining 4%, 80% are pointer errors. And the remaining 0.4% are hard. – Marc Donner, IBM Watson Research Center

      Seven Principles of Software Development - Revisited Principle #1: The Reason It All Exists A software system exists for one reason: to provide value to its users. All decisions should be made with this in mind. Before specifying a system requirement, before noting a piece of system functionality, before determining the hardware platforms or development processes, ask yourself questions such as: Does this add real VALUE to the system? If the answer is no, don&rsquo;t do it.

      nvm is a version manager for Node.js, designed to be installed per-user, and invoked per-shell. nvm works on any POSIX-compliant shell (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash), in particular on these platforms: Unix, Mac OS, and Windows WSL. But most of the times, it is not properly identified by eshell in Spacemacs. Recently I found out a package called nvm.el by Johan Andersson.
Let&rsquo;s walk you through how you can use nvm to choose different Node.

      What is Spacemacs? Spacemacs is a community-driven Emacs distribution. It is a new way to experience Emacs with a sophisticated and polished set-up focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.
What is Prettier? Prettier is an opinionated code formatter which supports many languages and integrates with most editors. It can be installed through npm. It is recommended to install prettier globally in your system so that your editor integrates it properly and can be even made to auto formatted while saving your files.

 Improve communication and streamline decision-making, and empower new leaders. Finish the major initiatives that have already been started. Ship a new edition, Ember Octane, focused on performance and productivity.  In this article we will focus on Ember Octane which is primarily targeted to improve performance of Ember applications for low-end devices and the like.

      Creating Connection-aware Ember Media Components In this article, we will take a look at creating Ember Components serving media content such as images and videos based on the network bandwidth of the users. For this, we will make use of the Network Information API provided by the browsers. Currently, the only browser that supports this api is Chrome, soon we are expecting that all the browsers will start supporting the network information api.

 Experimentum periculosm - Experimentation is perilous.
 This conservatism is both an asset and a liability. Both individual habits and institutionalized habits or rituals must be checked from time to time to see if they are working for us or against us.

If you want to know more about codemods, their building blocks and how they work, please check out this detailed post about codemods.

      In this article, we take a look at Codemods, a tool for making sweeping changes across your code with ease and effectiveness. Codemods are invented by a team of developers from Facebook to assist large-scale migrations in code-base, and we are going to take a deep look into a particular codemod tool called jscodeshift.
Refactoring Before we dive into the codemod tools like jscodeshift, we need to understand why we need to do large-scale refactorings and what is really meant by refactoring.

      A Refreshing Guide to Object.freeze in Javascript by Dr.Victor Fries What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age! In JavaScript, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. Objects penetrate almost every aspect of the JavaScript language. The object might be accessed as global or passed as an argument. Functions that have access to the object can modify the object, whether intentionally or accidentally. To prevent modification of our objects, one of the techniques is to use Object.

      Arguing for the sake of arguments in JavaScript This article deals with some intricacies revolving around the arguments object, a magical and mysterious creature residing in the functional realms of the Javascript world, which can be summoned anytime in your code by the programming wizards without any spells, incantations or sorcery. The arguments object is an Array-like object corresponding to the arguments passed to a function. It is a local variable available within all (non-arrow) functions.

Richard Sennett is a prime observer of society … one of his great strengths, the thing that makes his narrative so gripping, is the sheer range of his thinking and his brilliance in relating the past to the present.
The Craftsman is a complex but very rewarding read about craftsmanship, pride in one&rsquo;s work and the differences between individual work and mechanical production, and the intellectual investment in the former versus the more mechanistic approach in the latter.

      Creating Connection-aware Ember Media Components In this article, we will take a look at creating Ember Components serving media content such as images and videos based on the network bandwidth of the users. For this, we will make use of the Network Information API provided by the browsers. Currently, the only browser that supports this api is Chrome, soon we are expecting that all the browsers will start supporting the network information api.

      nvm is a version manager for Node.js, designed to be installed per-user, and invoked per-shell. nvm works on any POSIX-compliant shell (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash), in particular on these platforms: Unix, Mac OS, and Windows WSL. But most of the times, it is not properly identified by eshell in Spacemacs. Recently I found out a package called nvm.el by Johan Andersson.

      What is Spacemacs? Spacemacs is a community-driven Emacs distribution. It is a new way to experience Emacs with a sophisticated and polished set-up focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.
What is Prettier? Prettier is an opinionated code formatter which supports many languages and integrates with most editors. It can be installed through npm. It is recommended to install prettier globally in your system so that your editor integrates it properly and can be even made to auto formatted while saving your files.

      Seven Principles of Software Development - Revisited Principle #1: The Reason It All Exists A software system exists for one reason: to provide value to its users. All decisions should be made with this in mind. Before specifying a system requirement, before noting a piece of system functionality, before determining the hardware platforms or development processes, ask yourself questions such as: Does this add real VALUE to the system? If the answer is no, don&rsquo;t do it.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Conceptual integrity is the principle that anywhere you look in your system, you can tell that the design is part of the same overall design. This includes low-level issues such as formatting and identifier naming, but also issues such as how modules and classes are designed, etc. This is vitally important, because inevitably, unanticipated issues come up that must be resolved quickly. If there is a coherent design to the system, it can be much easier to resolve these issues by determining what would be consistent with the overall design, especially if the other designers are not present.

Although we all have opinions on these questions, we shall find that the answers are not as simple as we might wish.

      Egoless Programming Egoless programming is a concept introduced by Gerald Weinberg in The Psychology Of Computer Programming. The idea is that programmers must fight the natural tendency to treat their programs as part of themselves, and therefore to reject all criticism. Rather, they should do their best to treat their designs &amp; implementations as objects independent of themselves, and to view criticism dispassionately on its merits.

      Conceptual integrity is the principle that anywhere you look in your system, you can tell that the design is part of the same overall design. This includes low-level issues such as formatting and identifier naming, but also issues such as how modules and classes are designed, etc. This is vitally important, because inevitably, unanticipated issues come up that must be resolved quickly. If there is a coherent design to the system, it can be much easier to resolve these issues by determining what would be consistent with the overall design, especially if the other designers are not present.

All decisions should be made with this in mind. Before specifying a system requirement, before noting a piece of system functionality, before determining the hardware platforms or development processes, ask yourself questions such as: Does this add real VALUE to the system? If the answer is no, don&rsquo;t do it.

      In this article, we are going to take a glimpse at the ember-codemods-telemetry-helpers package and how it helps to create more advanced codemods for Ember.js.
If you want a more in-depth introduction to codemods, you can checkout this post detailing the why&rsquo;s and how&rsquo;s of codemods.
Telemetry for layman First we will take a look at what Telemetry is all about. According to Wikipedia,
 Telemetry is the collection of measurements or other data at remote or inaccessible points and their automatic transmission to receiving equipment for monitoring.

Since you don&rsquo;t have to lookup every time the alternative word you want to use and that too integrating with your favorite editor is definitely a feather in your cap.
For this we are going to install an awesome package from Ag Ibragimov called mw-thesaurus.

Experts in interpersonal communication have identified various response patterns that tend to block conversation. Thomas Gordon devised a comprehensive list that he calls the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; of communication spoilers. These undesirable responses include:
Criticizing Making a negative evaluation of the other person, his/her actions, or attitudes. The act of passing judgment as to the merits of anything; censure; faultfinding.

      In this post, we are going to share you a mind map of the book called The Craftsman by Richard Sennett.
Richard Sennett is a prime observer of society … one of his great strengths, the thing that makes his narrative so gripping, is the sheer range of his thinking and his brilliance in relating the past to the present.
The Craftsman is a complex but very rewarding read about craftsmanship, pride in one&rsquo;s work and the differences between individual work and mechanical production, and the intellectual investment in the former versus the more mechanistic approach in the latter.

      Software craftsmanship is an approach to software development that emphasizes the coding skills of the software developers themselves. It is a response by software developers to the perceived ills of the mainstream software industry, including the prioritization of financial concerns over developer accountability.
In this article we will take a look at different perspectives about craftsmanship in general and some specific notions of the same in software and programming from various authors and programmers.

 Experimentum periculosm - Experimentation is perilous.
 This conservatism is both an asset and a liability. Both individual habits and institutionalized habits or rituals must be checked from time to time to see if they are working for us or against us.

In fact, is the software building process even one of the major sources of uncertainty? Various project management approaches do not consider the impact that uncertainties have on the project. The identified threats by uncertainty in a project day-to-day are real and immediate and the expectations in a project are often high.
