Eight Elegant Quotes on Coding best practices
---------------------------------------------

### Quote #1

> **When in doubt, use brute force.** – Ken Thompson, Bell Labs

The brute force method, also known as Proof by exhaustion, proof by cases, proof by case analysis, or the complete induction, is a method of mathematical proof in which the statement to be proved is split into a finite number of cases or sets of equivalent cases and each type of case is checked to see if the proposition in question holds. This is a method of direct proof.

### Quote #2

> **Avoid Asymmetry.** – Andy Huber, Data General Corporation

Asymmetry is the absence of, or a violation of, symmetry (the property of an object being invariant to a transformation, such as reflection). Symmetry is an important property of both physical and abstract systems and it may be displayed in precise terms or in more aesthetic terms. The absence of or violation of symmetry that are either expected or desired can have important consequences for a system.

### Quote #8

> **Get your data structures correct them first, and the rest of the program will write itself.** – David Jones, Assen, The NetherLands

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
