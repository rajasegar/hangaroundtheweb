* Building a Trello Clone in Common Lisp
  In this post we are going to build a Trello clone demo application in
Common Lisp. It is just a demo app without any authentication or persistence,
it's going to focus mainly on the routing, user experience and api mechanisms.
We are going to use a couple of JavaScript libraries to enhance the user experience
like drag-n-drop, inline forms, etc.,

** Boards


** Lists
